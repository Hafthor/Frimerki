I want to build a email server using C#. I need it to support POP3, IMAP, SMTP protocols as well as all the other things that go into a modern email server. I also want it to support a web API interface so I can build a single-page application to both manage the email server and to provide a user interface for users to access their emails. I do not need this to be a scalable distributed system. I want this to run with a minimal amount of hardware and few additional dependencies. A key component of the email server will be a database to store user accounts, emails, and other metadata. I would like to use SQLite for this purpose due to its simplicity and minimal setup requirements. The email server should also support basic security features such as SSL/TLS for secure communication, and user authentication for accessing the email accounts. I would like to start by building a specification markdown file that describes the architecture of the email server, the key components, the protocols it will support, and the web API endpoints that will be available.

I'll help you create a comprehensive specification for your C# email server. Let me start by creating a detailed specification markdown file that outlines the architecture, components, protocols, and API endpoints.

Created EmailServer-Specification.md

I've created a comprehensive specification document for your C# email server project. The specification includes:

Key Highlights
Architecture: A modular design with separate services for SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, unified under a web API layer with SQLite as the database backend.

Complete Protocol Support:

SMTP (ports 25/587/465) with authentication and encryption
IMAP (ports 143/993) with folder management and real-time updates
POP3 (ports 110/995) for traditional email clients
Comprehensive Database Schema: Six main tables covering users, domains, messages, folders, user-message relationships, and attachments.

RESTful Web API: Full CRUD operations for messages, users, folders, and administrative functions, plus real-time notifications via SignalR.

Security Features: SSL/TLS encryption, JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

Minimal Dependencies: Uses .NET 8, SQLite, and proven libraries like MailKit and MimeKit to keep the system lightweight.

Development Phases: A structured 5-phase approach from core infrastructure to frontend applications.

The specification is designed for a self-contained system that can run on minimal hardware (2-4GB RAM, 1-2 CPU cores) while providing all the features of a modern email server. The SQLite database keeps setup simple while the modular architecture allows for future scaling if needed.

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or start creating the actual project structure and initial code files?
